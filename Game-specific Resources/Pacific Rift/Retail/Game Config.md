# Game Config
The game will not boot without ms2_config.cfg, a renamed XML file.\
\
There are a few different types of game config. These must be specified in the `type` tag (except races):
- BACK2BACK_TICKETS
- BENCHMARK
- DEVGHOSTCOPIER
- GUI (Default)
- MPSTRESS
- SOAK_TEST_ONLINE_HOST
- SOAK_TEST_RANDOM
- SOAK_TEST_REPEAT
- SOAK_TEST_SEQUENTIAL
- SOAK_TEST_SPLIT_SCREEN

The Includes section of the game config doesn't do anything.
